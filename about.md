I am a software engineer living in Chicago and an avid runner. Besides running, in my free time I like to learn about new open source projects and work on some projects of my own. I also am a huge sports fan (Cubs won the Word Series so all is right in the world!).


* Graduated the University of Michigan in 2016 with a B.S in Computer Science.
* Raced a Solar car in the Word Solar Challenge in 2013 ([more info](http://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu/2013/))
* Coordinated an [event](http://mrun.clubrunning.org/ram/) for the Special Olympics that raised almost $20,000
