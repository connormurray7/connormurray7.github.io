I finished deploying my small web app [link-aggregator](https://github.com/connormurray7/link-aggregator) to Linode this week, and it lives [here](http://link-aggregator.top). I learned a lot from having to deploy a web app and not just a backend application, which I primarily do at work. I will post a longer article about the steps that I took to deploy it because I found some of the other guides online to have the process partially covered or have outdated steps.

This week I also started refreshing myself with C++. At school I learned C++, but haven't used it since starting work and primarily coding in Java. But I was looking around online and came across [this presentation](http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv16/items/2.html) that had two really really great quotes in it.

> Most programming languages contain good and bad parts. I discovered that I
could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts.
After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?
It is rarely possible for standard committees to remove imperfections from a language
because doing so would cause the breakage of all the bad programs that depend on those
bad parts. […]
But you have the power to define your own subset. You can write better programs by
relying exclusively on the good parts.
