I finished deploying my small web app [link-aggregator](https://github.com/connormurray7/link-aggregator) to Linode this week, and it lives [here](http://link-aggregator.top). I learned a lot from having to deploy a web app and not just a backend application, which I primarily do at work. I will post a longer article about the steps that I took to deploy it because I found some of the other guides online to have the process partially covered or have outdated steps.
