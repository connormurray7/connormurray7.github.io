##### Deploying a web application on Linode

This week I worked on deploying my small application that I have been working on [link-aggregator](https://github.com/connormurray7/link-aggregator) to Linode. The application uses Nginx, Flask, Gunicorn, and Python. It has been a relatively easy process, and I just have to finish up with setting up the domain before it will be open for use. Next week I will have a longer post about the exact process that I went through to deploy.


### Next week

Thanksgiving, will take a week off from projects.
