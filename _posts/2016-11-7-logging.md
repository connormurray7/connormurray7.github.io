title: Python Logging from Multiple Modules to the Same File
---
This week I was adding logging functionality into the side project. I wanted pipe all of my output across several modules to the same file, but it doesn't seem like there is a immediately obvious way to do it. There are several options that I considered


#### 1. Pass the Same Handler Around
This was pretty simple and straightforward, I made my classes have a logging handler as a constructor argument, and in the `__init__` function it creates a new logger and adds a handler to it.

```python
class Foo:

  def __init__(self, handler):
      self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
      self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
      self.logger.addHandler(handler)
```



#### 2. Function that Generates a Logger with Handler
```python
def get_logger(name):
  rfh = RotatingFileHandler('log.log', maxBytes=100000, backupCount=5)
  logger = logging.getLogger(name)
  logger.addHandler(rfh)
  return logger
```
This function would then be imported wherever I needed to log anything. Every logger would then pipe to the same file.



#### 3. Using a Mixin
I ran across [this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15780151/how-to-use-python-logging-in-multiple-modules) about suggesting using a mixin for python classes, then if any class needed to log, they all could and to the same file. The downside is this acts like a root logger because there is only one instantiated. (This code is copied from that post for Python 3).
```python
class LogMixin:
    @property
    def logger(self):
        name = '.'.join([__name__, self.__class__.__name__])
        return logging.getLogger(name)
```


#### 4. Using a Configuration File

```python
logging.config.fileConfig('logging.conf')
#To get a logger
logger = logging.getLogger('foo')
```
Then here is the configuration file associated with it.

```
[loggers]
keys=foo

[handlers]
keys=file

[formatters]
keys=fileFormatter

[logger_foo]
level=INFO
handlers=file
propagate=0

[handler_file]
class=handlers.RotatingFileHandler
level=NOTSET
args=('log.log','a',100000,5)
formatter=fileFormatter

[formatter_fileFormatter]
format=%(asctime)s %(name)-12s: %(levelname)s %(message)s
```


Of all of these ways I ended up going with the first choice because my project is small and it ended up being relatively painless to add a handler to a few constructor arguments. I still am not sure which of the first three is the most Pythonic way of tackling the problem, and would be interested in hearing if anyone has suggestions about tackling this problem
