title: Writing Code Everyday
---
I wrote in my first [update](http://connormurray.me/Update1/), that the Software Engineering career is one of continuous learning, and much of that will be brushing up after work. I’m early in my career so I try to dedicate a lot of time to it after work (it’s not hard if you love it!). But I have found that just reading about new technologies is _not nearly good enough_. 

I started to read open source projects more closely, and they have been invaluable for learning how to structure code bases, how to write good documentation (and bad documentation), and [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) and [tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/master/tornado) for python, and [folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly) and [bde](https://github.com/bloomberg/bde) for C++ have all been extremely helpful for learning about how to write clean code that is also documented well. But even just reading good code isn’t enough.

Writing code/tests

- then fixing it 
- then refactoring 
- then rewriting it
- and writing documentation alongside

has been the best way that I’ve found to learn. 

I’ve been trying to get in the habit of writing some code everyday after work. Even though this sounds like an extended workday and that you might burnout, I feel it’s more like tinkering than working. And if I ever don’t have it in me then I’ll do some reading or watch some sports, consistency is better than working too hard for a few days and then not doing anything for a week or two. 

After trying to write some code after work almost everyday, I noticed that I can focus longer at work. Just like when I was starting to run cross-country, it took me months before I became conditioned to run longer — the same with software. College gave me a a good primer on conditioning, but you have to keep it up or you will get “out of shape”.
