title: Writing Code Everyday
---
I wrote in my first (update)[], that the Software Engineering career is one of continuous learning, and much of that will be brushing up after work. I’m early in my career so I try to dedicate a lot of time to it after work (it’s not hard if you love it!). But I have found that just reading about new technologies is not good enough. 

I started to study some open source projects, (requests) and (tornado) for python, and (folly) and (bloomberg/bde) for C++ have all been extremely helpful for learning about how to write clean code that is also documented well. But even just reading good code isn’t enough. 

Writing code and then fixing it, and then refactoring, and writing documentation is the best way that I’ve found to learn. I’ve been trying to get in the habit of writing some code everyday after work.
